-Every command packet will look different.

-First 8 bytes is always the command string


-There is a interface that all the commands implement.
-There is a packet interpreter that looks at the packet and gives the control to command object to handle the connection
    -The FD is handed over to the packet interpreter as soon as connection is established
    -If first 8 bytes of the FD upon connection is not a recognized command it, will throw an exextion
    -The interpreter consumes the command part of the incommig packet from the FD, then hands over the control to command object
